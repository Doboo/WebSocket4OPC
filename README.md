# WebSocket4OPC
Enable WebSocket in OPC DA/AE Server with JSON return, first time ever

DCOM was developed more than 2 decades ago and that was the technology classic OPC started with. Young kids get out of school with dynamic languages on hand. They care about writing a few line scripts to bring data back rather than knowing how it happens under hood, and it is anti-intuitive to get their feet wet on this legacy. With the adoption of WebSocket everywhere it is time to introspect how to combine this new technology with old DCOM.
The solution, WebSocket4OPC, is such an exploration. It utilizes WebSocket in IIS to communicate with OPC server and wraps all dirty work in simple JSON return. This solution gets rid of DCOM completely since IIS and OPC servers are hosted in the same one.
